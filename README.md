TODO: If you're interested in a fun little project using a servo and a Raspberry Pi, this project might be for you. The project has you setting up a webpage that has buttons, a camera feed, and other UI elements on it. When you click the buttons they send messages back to the servo, which rotates and has a camera on it. 
## Usage
TODO:i use it to watch my cat when I'm away, but I'm sure you can find more interesting uses. 

There is plenty to learn and a lot of fun frameworks to play with. My usage of the servo libraries is bad. There are plenty of better ways to get the servo to spin that aren't as janky. So feel free to let me know where I went wrong!
